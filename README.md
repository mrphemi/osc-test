# Mini Basket

- View product list
- View single product
- Change product quantity and add to cart.
- View cart with items and subtotal
- Update cart items (change quantity)
- Delete item from cart

### Technologies Used

- React with Next.js (new app router)
- Tailwind CSS
- GraphQL and graphQL-request for data fetching
- Typescript

### Todos (Couldn't implement some because of time constraint)

- Better add to cart notifications.
- Tracking and displaying number of items in cart on all pages.
- Replace data fetching in useEffects with technologies like react-query.
- Enable throttling/debouncing on add/subtract quantity buttons for cart items.
- Better typing specifically for Api responses. Using `any` keyword defeats the purpose of typescript.
