### Technologies Used

- Tailwind CSS
- GraphQL and graphQL-request for data fetching
- Typescript

### Todos

- Better add to cart notifications.
- Tracking and displaying number of items in cart on all pages.
- Replace data fetching in useEffects with technologies like react-query.
- Enable throttling/debouncing on add/subtract quantity buttons for cart items.
- Better typing specifically for Api responses. Using `any` keyword defeats the purpose of typescript.
